# üìå REST API Web Client

This project is a **REST API web client** that allows users to communicate with a remote server using **socket connections and HTTP requests**. It provides functionalities for **user authentication, library access, and book management**, using **GET, POST, and DELETE requests**. The client is built in **C++** and interacts with the server through **manually constructed HTTP requests**, making it lightweight and efficient.
